## What is Nuxt SmartScript?

Nuxt SmartScript is a powerful Nuxt module that automatically transforms typography patterns in your content to enhance readability and visual appeal. It works seamlessly with your existing Nuxt application, requiring minimal configuration.

## Why SmartScript?

### üéØ Problem

Web content often contains patterns like (TM), (R), chemical formulas (H2O), and ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd) that could be displayed more professionally with proper typography.

### ‚ú® Solution

SmartScript automatically detects and transforms these patterns into beautifully formatted typography with proper superscripts, subscripts, and symbols - all while maintaining accessibility.

## Quick Example

**Input:**
```
Your Product(TM) is the 1st choice for quality!
H2O and CO2 are common molecules.
E=mc^2 is Einstein's famous equation.
```

**Output:**
- Your Product‚Ñ¢ is the 1<sup>st</sup> choice for quality!
- H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> are common molecules.
- E=mc<sup>2</sup> is Einstein's famous equation.

## Installation

Install the module to your Nuxt application with one command:

```bash
npm install @mitre/nuxt-smartscript
```

Add it to your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@mitre/nuxt-smartscript']
})
```

That's it! SmartScript will automatically enhance your typography.
